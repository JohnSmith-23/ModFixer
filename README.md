Created for ease use when it comes to Manual Installation of Mods and to fix any errors that may occur during the process. Pinpoints which mods are causing an error in mass installation and can be used to verify mod versions compared to current game versions. Works for all games currently.
Simply run the exe file and then choose the mod folders, and game root folders, and then check compatibility. 
More Features coming soon.
